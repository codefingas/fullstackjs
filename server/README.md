<h1>How it works</h1><hr/>
A user comes online...<br/>
He sees a list of available items...<br/>
<i>The user also has the option of shopping by budget<br/>
Where he puts in the amount that he has and <br/>
automatically items that "fits in" to that budget would get returned as results..
</i><br/>
He "Adds to Cart"('used my vanilla Js cart plugin -- soo cool..')<br/>
Checks out,('where NODEjs comes in')<br/>
He passes the necessary information on check Out..<br/>
and then this "Information" - which includes:-<br/>
(1). The Purchase Request..<br/>
(2). The Users Email<br/>
(3). The User's Phone Number<br/>
(4). The User's description of how he wants his delivery handled<br/>
Gets sent as Email ("Used Nodemailer for this -- Used BodyParser to collect the form details")<br/>
to both the site's owner email address and the client..<br/>

<h2>Running it on your localhost</h2>
$ git clone or download as zip<br/>
$ npm install<br/>
$ npm start

<h1>Remarks</h1><hr/>
In future times, Hope to Extend what NODEjs does on the platform.<br/>
Working on a Shopping System buildt Entirely on NODEjs..<br/>
When that is done, would release<br/>
the V 2.0 of this project...

<h1>Disclaimer</h1>
This Project is sort of an imitation of QTEE a shopping website<br/>
I kinda "stumbled" on ..<br/>
I loved the design and also its simplicity("User Experience")<br/>
so  i buildt something similar to it..so i take no credit for the my designs beauty beauty<br/>
